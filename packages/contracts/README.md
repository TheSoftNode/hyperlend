# 🚀 HyperLend - Ultra-Fast DeFi Lending Protocol

> **Built for Somnia Network's 1M+ TPS Capability**

HyperLend is a revolutionary DeFi lending protocol designed to leverage Somnia Network's unprecedented transaction throughput and sub-second finality. This protocol introduces **micro-liquidations**, **real-time interest rate updates**, and **instant risk management** - features that were impossible on traditional blockchains.

## 🏆 Hackathon Project

**Somnia DeFi Mini Hackathon Entry**  
**Track**: DeFi Protocols  
**Timeline**: 3 weeks development  
**Status**: Ready for deployment on Somnia testnet

## 🌟 Key Innovations

### 1. **Micro-Liquidations** ⚡
- Execute thousands of tiny liquidations per second instead of large liquidation events
- Leverages Somnia's 1M+ TPS for granular risk management
- Prevents cascading liquidations and market crashes

### 2. **Real-Time Interest Rates** 💹
- Interest rates update every block based on utilization
- Dynamic APY adjustments in real-time
- No more waiting for governance proposals

### 3. **Instant Risk Management** ⚠️
- Sub-second health factor calculations
- Real-time collateral ratio monitoring
- Automated risk mitigation

### 4. **Somnia-Optimized** 🚀
- Built specifically for Somnia's EVM compatibility
- Optimized gas usage for high-frequency operations
- Leverages sub-second finality for instant confirmations

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Contracts (5 Main Contracts)

1. **`HyperLendPool.sol`** - Main lending pool with real-time metrics
2. **`InterestRateModel.sol`** - Dynamic interest rate calculations
3. **`LiquidationEngine.sol`** - Micro-liquidation execution engine
4. **`PriceOracle.sol`** - Real-time price feeds with deviation protection
5. **`RiskManager.sol`** - Automated risk assessment and mitigation

### Token Contracts

- **`HLToken.sol`** - Supply position tokens
- **`DebtToken.sol`** - Borrow position tokens  
- **`RewardToken.sol`** - Liquidation rewards and incentives

### Supporting Infrastructure

- **Libraries**: Math, SafeTransfer, ReentrancyGuard
- **Interfaces**: Complete interface definitions for all contracts
- **Mock Contracts**: For testing and development

## 🚀 Quick Start
