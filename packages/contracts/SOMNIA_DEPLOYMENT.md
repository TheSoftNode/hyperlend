### 🔮 **Oracle Integration Setup**

#### DIA Oracle Integration

```solidity
// Update these addresses with real DIA oracle addresses
DIA_ORACLE_ADDRESS=0x1A1B3F8Bb961e4D0d3ed3c5A1eb2F7D4B3F2DaE4
STT_USD_PRICE_FEED=0x3C3D5H0Dd173g6F2f5f5f7B3gd4G9F6F5G4FcC6
```

#### Protofire Oracle Integration

```solidity
// Update these addresses with real Protofire oracle addresses
PROTOFIRE_ORACLE_ADDRESS=0x2B2C4G9Cc062f5E1e4f4e6A2fc3F8E5E4F3EbB5
```

### ⚡ **Somnia-Specific Optimizations Applied**

#### 1. Gas Optimizations

- [x] Increased optimizer runs to 1000
- [x] Enabled intermediate representation (viaIR)
- [x] Optimized contract size for high throughput
- [x] Efficient batch operations

#### 2. Network Configuration

- [x] Proper Somnia testnet/devnet chain IDs (50312/50311)
- [x] Optimized gas limits (8M gas)
- [x] Fast confirmation times (1-2 blocks)
- [x] Custom explorer URLs for verification

#### 3. Protocol Optimizations

- [x] Reduced liquidation delays (60 seconds vs 5 minutes)
- [x] Real-time price updates (30-second intervals)
- [x] Fast liquidation engine for sub-second finality
- [x] Micro-liquidation support for precision

#### 4. Native STT Integration

- [x] Somnia wrapper for native STT token
- [x] Zero address convention for native token
- [x] Fast wrap/unwrap operations
- [x] Optimized for 1M+ TPS environment

### 🛠️ **Development Commands**

```bash
# Quick deployment and test
npm run deploy:somnia-optimized

# Run all tests
npm test

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage

# Check contract sizes
npm run size

# Clean and recompile
npm run clean && npm run compile

# Gas usage report
npm run gas-report
```

### 📊 **Performance Benchmarks for Somnia**

#### Expected Performance Metrics:

- **Transaction Throughput**: 1M+ TPS capability
- **Finality Time**: Sub-second
- **Gas Efficiency**: <300k gas per supply/borrow
- **Liquidation Speed**: <1 minute end-to-end
- **Price Update Frequency**: 30-second intervals
- **Oracle Response Time**: <5 seconds

### 🚨 **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### Issue 1: Oracle Address Errors

```bash
# Solution: Update oracle addresses in .env with real Somnia addresses
DIA_ORACLE_ADDRESS=<actual_address>
PROTOFIRE_ORACLE_ADDRESS=<actual_address>
```

#### Issue 2: Gas Estimation Failures

```bash
# Solution: Increase gas limits in hardhat config
gasLimit: 8000000
```

#### Issue 3: Native STT Integration

```bash
# Solution: Use zero address for native STT
const STT_ADDRESS = ethers.constants.AddressZero;
```

#### Issue 4: Network Connection Issues

```bash
# Solution: Use backup RPC endpoints
FALLBACK_TESTNET_RPC=https://backup-testnet.somnia.network/
```
